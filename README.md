# React Quiz App

This is a simple quiz app built with React. It uses a local JSON file to store the questions and serve them with JSON server as a Fake API. It is part of the course that I'm currently taking ([The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/)). The main goal of this project is to practice React and learn how to build a simple quiz app using the useReducer hook.

## Technologies used
I preferred to use different technologies than those used in the course to build this app, such as Vite and TypeScript.

## To do

I would actually like to add some features to this app, as proposed in the course, such as:
- [ ] Store the high score using a fake API
- [ ] Store the answers to have the possibility to get back and forth between questions
- [ ] Choose the difficulty of the questions
- [ ] Fix some styling issues
